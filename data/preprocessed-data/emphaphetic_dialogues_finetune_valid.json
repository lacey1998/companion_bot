Was it sudden?|Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.|That sounds fun! Where did you go?|That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?|Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?|How long had you been married ?|That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.|That is a good thing then|You mean nostalgic?|Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?|Oh my goodness, did you go to check what the noise was?|Oh that's so great!|You sound very confident. That's good|I am bad at every game.|Yes, I like your attitude. |That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.|I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.|What prompted his back flip?|I hope you would wear a belt next time.|Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!|Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage|That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?|That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!|That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs, so I feel your annoyance.|Exactly good luck|Yes, I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?|I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?|I agree, I eat what I want when I want all the time.|you are very welcome. good luck!|Wow, did they notice?|On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?|Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.|Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!|I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?|Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?|I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.|Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!|It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?|Right, but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track.|Why did he do that?|I wish you luck|Yeah, flying can be scary.|ooops sorry to hear that|That's amazing! You must be so proud.|I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat.|Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!|That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable|Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here|That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!|why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?|Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...|Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?|When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?|That is exactly the way you are supposed to feel. Did you get the job?|and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?|You can always show her the ways|Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?|I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?|I'm so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?|Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.|That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted, especially when some people say it's in its worst state in a long time.\" We're prisoners of the moment.|Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there|That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?|yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything|Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.|An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.|I'm glad that it all worked out!|Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?|You have a test coming up?|That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?|You need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam|OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?|That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?|That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.|I hate burger king! McD's all the way|Yeah, I am sure it will be fine|I am always scared about those airbags!  I am so glad you are ok!|Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?|What are you planning on doing with it?|I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.|Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.|Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.|Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too|yeeees. I am alos supporting France. I hope it wins|A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?|Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.|Good luck on the exam! |What did she surprise you with?|well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!|Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!|Have you tried to call her?|Come on, you do not have to be jealous of your brother|Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either|That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.|I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often? |I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?|Did you share it with anyone else?|You have some very nice parents, when I graduated my parents said pay us more rent now. \nUser: An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA, I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. \nChatbot: Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.\nUser: I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.\nChatbot: Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?"
