Do you not live close to a beach?\nUser: Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.\nChatbot: That must suck not living close to a beach. Hopefully you get to go back real soon."
